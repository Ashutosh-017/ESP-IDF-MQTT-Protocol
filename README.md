# ESP32 MQTT Example

This is an example project that demonstrates how to establish a Wi-Fi connection on an ESP32 device and connect to an MQTT broker using the ESP-IDF framework. The code sets up a Wi-Fi connection, connects to an MQTT broker, and demonstrates basic MQTT operations such as subscribing to topics and publishing messages.

## Prerequisites

Before running this code, ensure that you have the following:

- An ESP32 development board
- ESP-IDF framework installed on your development machine
- Wi-Fi credentials (SSID and password)
- MQTT broker URI and optional authentication details

## Getting Started

To run this code on your ESP32 device, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the code as a ZIP file.

2. Connect your ESP32 device to your computer.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

4. Configure the project by running the following command:

   ```
   idf.py menuconfig
   ```

   In the configuration menu, set the Wi-Fi credentials, MQTT broker URI, and other settings as required.

5. Build and flash the code to your ESP32 device using the following command:

   ```
   idf.py -p PORT flash
   ```

   Replace `PORT` with the appropriate serial port connected to your ESP32 device.

6. After flashing, monitor the device's output by running:

   ```
   idf.py -p PORT monitor
   ```

   You should see the device attempting to connect to Wi-Fi and then connecting to the MQTT broker if successful.

## Usage

The ESP32 device will automatically attempt to connect to the configured Wi-Fi network on startup. Once connected, it will connect to the MQTT broker using the provided URI. The device subscribes to the topic `/topic/test1` and `/topic/test2` and publishes messages to those topics.

You can modify the topics and messages by editing the code. Additionally, you can customize the behavior of the MQTT client by adjusting the configuration parameters in the code.

## Troubleshooting

- If the device fails to connect to Wi-Fi, ensure that the provided Wi-Fi credentials are correct and the network is available.

- If the device fails to connect to the MQTT broker, verify that the broker URI and authentication details (if applicable) are correct.

- Check the device's output in the serial monitor for any error messages or debug information that can help diagnose issues.
